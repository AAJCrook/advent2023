Left was working fine. I had some basic logical issues with my right that lead me to either:
1. Not consider the far right char for word numbers
2. Not consider 1-2 far left char for word numbers
The code here now is good. I think I sacrificed too much in the seardch of a "theoretical optimum" when I should have just done something working first.
(What I tried might not even be optimum in the left and right == same number case!)
